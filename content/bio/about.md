# About me

Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Prasanna. I am an aspiring documentary photographer based in Bangalore, India. I started off working on the streets of my city to gain an appreciation for the photographic art form. Over the last six years, while balancing work and personal challenges I have managed to create a small body of work. I hope you find images you connect with here.

I am drawn to deeper narratives that go beyond the single image to showcase the power of visual storytelling. I care deeply about the challenges faced by everyday people and communities. I resonate with the stories that seldom find space in magazine folds. Lives of people navigating a choatic world of capitalism, migration in search of economic prosperity and socio-cultural shifts occurring thereof. If you have a story that you would like to share, please reach out to me via my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/vogxn) or [email](mailto:mailerdaemon@duck.com)
