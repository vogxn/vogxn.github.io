# About me

Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Prasanna. I am a photographer based in Bangalore, India. I started off working on the streets of my city to gain an appreciation for the photographic art form. Over the last several years, while balancing work and personal challenges I have managed to create a small body of work. I hope you find images you connect with here.

I am drawn to the lives of everyday people and communities living through extraordinary times. I resonate with stories about people navigating a choatic world of capitalism, environmental degradation, migration in search of economic prosperity and socio-cultural shifts occurring thereof. If you would like to get in touch, reach out to me via my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/vogxn) or [email](mailto:srivatsav.prasanna@gmail.com).
